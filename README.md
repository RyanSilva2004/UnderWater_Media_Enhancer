    <h1>üåä Open Source - Underwater Media Enhancer</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Underwater Media Enhancement</strong> repository! This project provides a robust solution for enhancing underwater images and videos using a range of Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques. Our mission is to improve the visibility and quality of underwater imagery by tackling common issues like haze, poor contrast, and color distortion.</p>
    <p>Take a look at this side-by-side comparison of an original underwater image and its enhanced version using our techniques:</p>

    <br><br>
    <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Running the Python Application</h2>
    <p>You can use the Python applications <code>UWME_UI.py</code> and <code>UWME.py</code> or the executable <code>Underwater Media Enhancer v0.1.exe</code> to enhance both images and videos. These tools provide a comprehensive solution for underwater media enhancement.</p>

    <h2>‚ú® Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dehazing:</strong> Implemented using the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) technique, this feature effectively reduces haze, significantly improving image clarity.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Correction:</strong> Balances colors to counter the blue/green tint typical of underwater photos, restoring natural hues.</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast Enhancement:</strong> Boosts contrast to bring out details and enrich overall image quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Edge Preservation:</strong> Maintains sharpness and fine details during the enhancement process using advanced filters.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>üîç Techniques and Concepts</h2>
    <h3>1. Dark Channel Prior (DCP)</h3>
    <p>The DCP technique is essential for dehazing underwater images. This method leverages the observation that in most non-hazy outdoor images, at least one color channel has some pixels with very low intensities in any local region. In underwater images, DCP helps estimate haze thickness and remove it effectively.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>2. Color Balance Adjustment</h3>
    <p>Due to light absorption and scattering in water, underwater images often have a blue/green cast. Our color balance adjustment technique corrects this by equalizing the histograms of the red, green, and blue channels, restoring the natural colors.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>3. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)</h3>
    <p>CLAHE enhances image contrast by working on small regions called tiles. This ensures that the histogram of each tile matches a desired distribution, avoiding over-amplification of noise while improving image detail.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>4. Edge Preservation Smoothing</h3>
    <p>We use edge-preserving smoothing filters like the Bilateral Filter to smooth images without blurring edges, which is crucial for maintaining the fine details in underwater images.</p>
    <br>
